# Word Cloud

## Load Packages
```r
library(rtweet) #get tweet from Twitter API
library(dplyr)  #summarise
library(wordcloud) #package to generate a word cloud 
library(tm)
```

## Authantication
```r
# twitter_tokens <- 
#  create_token(app = "S326",
#               consumer_key = "Z9yJu2xgTrcTqCHJvOkn8vz6E",
#               consumer_secret = "H9IySsPPZE5GbjdSJYNyzprS80LfvXuuOTCOLSu0IjkpCUW2zo")
```

## Data Collection
```r
#climate_tweets <- search_tweets("climate change", n = 200, include_rts = FALSE)
#saveRDS(climate_tweets, file = "climate_tweets.rds")
```

## read RDS file
```r
climate_tweets<-readRDS(file = "climate_tweets.rds")
```

## Corpus (èªžæ–™åº«)
clean up the data(string) into useful word sets
1. remove punctuation
2. remove meaningless words
3. reduce spaces

### Generate corpus
```r
temp=VectorSource(climate_tweets$text)
corpus <- Corpus(temp) #Corpus is a function to transform vectors into a corpus 
inspect(corpus[1:5])
```
